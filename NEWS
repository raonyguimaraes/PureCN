Focus on PureCN 1.2 was to dramatically improve user-friendliness:

- GATK requirement was dropped: PureCN now comes with functionality to
  generate coverage data when GATK is not available.

- Automatic curation of results was added.

- Output plots were polished.


Performance enhancements:

- More thorough initial grid search should minimize cases where pruity/ploidy
  is wrong because the solution was not considered.

- More robust and accurate likelihood model.  

- Support for SNVs outside the copy number interval file
  (remove.off.target.snvs=FALSE).   

- Improved segmentation and log-ratio normalization.  


Other new features:

- Functions to calculate power to detect mono-clonal and sub-clonal somatic
  mutations (Carter et al., Nature Biotech, 2012) were added.
