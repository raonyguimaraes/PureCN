Changes in version 1.6.0
------------------------

- Automatic 50bp interval padding
- Added sub-clonal SNV state (SOMATIC.M0)
- Polished plots, added new GC-normalization plot
- Support for cell lines
- Improved somatic vs. germline status calling
- Better mapping bias estimation and correction
- Better copy number normalization using multiple best normals


API CHANGES

- Deprecated functions: createSNPBlacklist
- Defunct functions: createExonWeightFile
- Changed defaults: 
    - min.normals 5 (from 10) in setMappingBiasVcf
    - max.segments 300 (from 200) in runAbsoluteCN               
- Other minor changes:
    - Renamed some predictSomatic() output column names
    - Moved remove.off.target.snvs to filterVcfBasic
    - Dropped BED file support in calculateGCContentByInterval
      Instead provide support for GRanges
    - poolCoverage: w argument now used as provided, not 
        normalized so that w[1] is 1
 
 
PLANNED FEATURES 

- Support for indels
- Better runtime performance by ignoring unlikely solutions early
- Better support for known, small deletions and amplifications (e.g. EGFRvIII,
  MYC)
- Better support for pool of normals
- Switch to S4 data structures (maybe)
- Whole dataset visualizations (maybe PureCN 1.8)
