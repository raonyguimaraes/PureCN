Focus on PureCN 1.2 was to dramatically improve user-friendliness. GATK
requirement was dropped, and PureCN now comes with functionality to generate
necessary coverage data when GATK is not available.

Automatic curation of results was added.

Output plots were polished.

Functions to calculate power to detect mono-clonal and sub-clonal somatic
mutations (Carter et al., Nature Biotech, 2012) were added.
